# Cyberdeck-test-kernal
the idea is that it will flash a simple logo or something so I know right away that everything is talking to itself properly

I have a pi zero w2 and a 2.13" b/w e ink display and some other hardware (USB hub; battery; mechanical keyboard),
which I need to emulate so I can rapidly develop a bare metal OS, for it.
ChatGPT will be helping me, so its a real blind leading the blind situation, wish me luck!

My design goals for this project are just to make sure that the code I write for my hardware emulator (particularly the screen) actually translates into the real hardware as it should.

This repository is part of a 3 repository project.
